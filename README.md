# The Bank of Mill Valley
60 Thockmorton Ave., Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History
The Bank of Mill Valley (now Bank of America) was built in 1911 and was the first architecturally significant building of public nature to be built in Mill Valley.  Originally, the bank had two entrances, one facing Throckmorton and one facing Corte Madera Ave.

"This building was built by Harvey Klyce in 1911. It was the first masonry
building in Mill Valley. The Bank of Mill Valley moved here from its previous
location at Throckmorton and Madrona. In 1926 the Bank of Mill Valley was
acquired by the Bank of Italy founded by Amadeo Peter Giannini in 1904. In
1930, he changed the bank’s name to the Bank of America National Trust and
Savings Association (BofA NTSA).

The Pacific Telephone exchange initially occupied the west part of the building
until 1948 when it moved to its new building on the corner of East Blithedale
and Walnut. Dimitroff’s picture frame shop was the occupant until 1960 when
it moved to #173 Throckmorton. The bank then expanded into the space." Source: [Mill Valley Historical Society](https://www.mvhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/plugin-hist-walk-guidebook-2007.pdf)
