# Bank of Mill Valley
60 Thockmorton Ave., Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

The classically-inspired Bank of Mill Valley building lent much dignity and distinction to the downtown business quarter when it was erected at the corner of Throckmorton and Corte Madera Avenues in 1911. 

The building’s design and construction was managed by Harvey Klyce, a Mill Valley general contractor and town trustee. The foundations were made of reinforced concrete and the main structure was faced with brick and terracotta.  The Throckmorton façade featured a central front pediment supported by four Corinthian pilasters and two massive plate glass windows at either side of the doorway.  A second entrance faced Corte Madera.  

The Bank of Mill Valley was established in 1907 and operated for four years from a building at the corner of Throckmorton and Madrona Avenues.  The bank prospered along with the growth of Mill Valley following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.  The bank’s stockholders authorized a $50,000 capital expense to purchase the lot at Throckmorton and Corte Madera and to construct the new building.  Construction began in February 1911 and the bank was installed in its new home on July 1, 1911.  In 1926, the Bank of Mill Valley was acquired by the Bank of Italy. In 1930, the bank’s name changed again to the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association.

The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Exchange Service occupied the west part of the building until 1948 when it moved to East Blithedale and Walnut. Dimitroff’s Picture Frame Shop became the secondary occupant until 1960 when it moved to 173 Throckmorton. The bank then expanded into the space. *
